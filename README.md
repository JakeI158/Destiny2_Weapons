# Destiny2_Weapons
This is a SQL analysis of various weapons that can be found in the video game, Destiny 2.

I wanted to practice my SQL skills and found a dataset related to my favorite game.
This project was inspired by agno3317 and their d2guns project here:
https://github.com/agno3317/d2guns

I originally discovered the dataset here:
https://www.kaggle.com/vishwasrao99/destiny-2-guns?select=guns.csv

I've made a few changes to the original dataset, so I will upload my version of the data to this project.

The file is named 'guns_v2.csv'

NOTE: Line 409 id formatted incorrectly in the file preview, this is explained and fixed in the SQL statements.

This SQL project covers the same actions using MS SQL Server (T-SQL) and pgAdmin (PostgreSQL).

This project will cover creating the table needed as well as queries exploring that data and updating certain aspects of the data.
I am currently working on creating a Tableau visualization to accompany this data (COMING SOON).
